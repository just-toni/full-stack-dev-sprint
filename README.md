# Full Stack Dev Sprint - Day 1 Guide

Welcome to the `guided/day1` branch of the Full Stack Development Sprint! This branch is tailored for the first day of our sprint, providing you with a pre-configured React application. It serves as an ideal starting point for understanding basic state management, routing, components setup, and custom styling in React.

## Getting Started

This branch comes with a React app that has been set up for you, showcasing some foundational concepts in React development without the use of Material UI for styles.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
- Git
- Node.js
- A preferred code editor (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc.)

### Setup

Follow these steps to get the React app running on your local machine:

1. If you haven't already cloned the repository, do so with the following command:
   ```
   git clone <your-forked-url>
   ```
2. Switch to the `guided/day1` branch to access the pre-configured React app:
   ```
   git checkout guided/day1
   ```
3. Navigate to the `client` folder where the React app is located:
   ```
   cd client
   ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the React app to see it in action:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features of the Branch

This branch includes the following setups and features:

- **State Management:** Demonstrates basic usage of React's state management to handle user inputs, data, and application state.
- **Routing:** Utilizes React Router for navigating between different components in the app, showcasing a single-page application behavior.
- **Components Setup:** Contains pre-built React components that serve as the building blocks for the application's UI.
- **Custom Styles:** Instead of relying on Material UI, this branch uses custom CSS for styling, offering a glimpse into how to personalize your app's appearance.

## Exploring the Code

As you explore the codebase, you'll find comments and documentation intended to guide you through understanding how each part of the application works. This hands-on approach is designed to complement the day 1 presentation, providing you with practical experience in React development.

## Conclusion

By the end of your exploration of this branch, you should have a solid understanding of some core React concepts, including state management, routing, component structure, and custom styling. This foundation will serve you well as you continue to build and enhance your full-stack development skills.

Should you have any questions or encounter any issues, please refer back to the presentation materials or feel free to reach out for support.

Happy coding!

- This is the main branch, is just a basic created app with one button in the middle. It has Material UI setup, however, I recommend not using it but you may if you want.
- The guided/day1 branch has guided code you will need to follow along with the presentation. You may use this to start building your project. To switch to that branch, run this command:
  ```
  git checkout guided/day1
  ```
- The client folder has the frontend base code for React JS, and the server has the backend base code for Node JS.
